Free software, software libre, or libre software[1] is computer software that is distributed along with its source code, and is released under a software license that guarantee users the freedom to run the software for any purpose as well as to study, adapt/modify, and distribute the original software and the adapted/changed versions.[2][3][4][5][6] Free software is often developed collaboratively by volunteer computer programmers.

Free software differs from proprietary software (such as Microsoft Windows), which to varying degrees does not give the user freedoms to study, modify and share the software, and threatens users with legal penalties if they do not conform to the terms of restrictive software licenses. Proprietary software is usually sold as a binary executable program without access to the source code, which prevents users from modifying and patching it, and results in the user becoming dependent on software companies (vendor lock-in) to provide updates and support. Free software is also distinct from freeware, which does not require payment for use, but includes software where the authors or copyright holders of freeware have retained all of the rights to the software, so that it is not necessarily permissible to reverse engineer, modify, or redistribute freeware.[7][8] Thus, free software is primarily a matter of liberty, not price: users are free to do whatever they want with it â€“ this includes the freedom to redistribute the software free-of-charge, or to sell it (or related services such as support or warranty) for profit.[9]

The term "free software" was coined in 1985 by Richard Stallman, during the founding of the GNU project (a collaborative effort to create a freedom-respecting operating system) and the Free Software Foundation (FSF). The FSF's Free Software Definition[4] states that users of free software are "free" because they do not need to ask for any permission; and they are not restricted in activities through restrictive proprietary licenses (e.g. copy-restriction), or requirements of having to agree to restrictive terms of others (e.g. non-disclosure agreements), and they are not already restricted from the outset (e.g. through deliberate non-availability of source code).[10]
